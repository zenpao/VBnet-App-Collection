SIDE NOTE:

Do not place within root folder sub directories which asks special permissions e.g (Program Files, Program Files(x86), etc.).
The solution was made with Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and available in VS 2012. The program used Visual Basic.NET 
with primary interop assembly. The application can be run with its .EXE shortcut, hence, if lost, navigate to the 
DTTS folder\bin\Debug\DTTS.exe .

Thank you for using DTTS.
